[**FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT IN BIOINFORMATICS: AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR CANCER RESEARCH**]

**Introduction**

Frontend development plays an important role in bioinformatics, for biologists in particular, who frequently find command line interfaces to be difficult to use, any new bioinformatic tool must be made available to the community of users. By putting in place a dedicated website, this demand is primarily met. To facilitate tool integration within automatically-generated web pages and make them accessible through a general online user interface, a number of solutions, including Galaxy and Mobyle were created. These general strategies enable the integration of numerous bioinformatic tools under a single interface concept (Goecks, 2010; Neron, 2009).

Web-based dashboards have taken the lead in cancer research through application in bioinformatics for outstanding achievements in the field of frontend development. It is through these types of applications that dashboards can offer data exploration and visualization of genomic studies, clinical trials, and other data. For instance, cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics presents its users with an interactive interface to retrieve cancer genomics data for the study of genetic alterations across a wide range of cancer types. This is a very good example of how front-end development can be used to provide access to bioinformatics tools in a better manner (Cerami, 2012). 

Moreover, with frontend development, one can achieve interactive visualizations crucial in the interpretation of bioinformatics data. Some of the most used tools in making dynamic graphs and charts to help researchers in identifying patterns and relationships within big datasets are D3.js and Plotly. This is very important in cancer research, where demand for great data complexity meets sophisticated graphical representations that enable understanding and the process of decision-making (Bostock, 2011).

In cancer research, frontend development allows capability of visualization for an elaborate dataset, including gene expression profiles or mutation data. The Cancer Genome Atlas, as part of such study initiatives, for instance, offers a web interface that allows users to mine genomic data across diverse cancer types. Frontend development with regard to the TCGA web portal ensures access to data by the users' analysis with ease, hence supporting the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets (Liu, 2021). 

**Conclusion**

Nevertheless, it's evident that frontend development is essential to contemporary cancer bioinformatics research. The progress of cancer research and therapy has been made possible by its user-friendly interfaces, which facilitate the study and evaluation of complex datasets. The need of frontend development for promoting creativity and enhancing patient outcomes grows as the sector advances.

## **CALCULATORS**

### **Serial Dilution Calculator**
This tool allows you to calculate the volumes needed to achieve specific concentrations through serial dilutions.

**How to Use**:
1. Enter the Initial Concentration of the stock solution.
2. Specify the Desired Final Concentration.
3. Input the Dilution Factor (e.g., 1:10).
4. Enter the Total Volume required for the dilution.
5. Click **Calculate** to display the volume of stock solution needed at each dilution step.

**Example**:  
You want to create a series of 1:10 dilutions from a 100 mM stock solution to achieve 10mM.
